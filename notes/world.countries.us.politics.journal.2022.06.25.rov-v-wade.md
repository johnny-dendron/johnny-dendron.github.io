## The Day The Music Died

> On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court overruled Roe in [[Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women%27s_Health_Organization]].

I saw it on the news. I wouldn't have, but I decided I'd eat lunch and at the deli the new was on.

It happened.

### **Roe V Wade**

_...gone with a stroke of a pen._

And like COVID, and Russia invading Ukraine, and Trump attempting a violent coup of the United States; I knew it was coming but somehow also didn't believe it.

We all knew. The Supreme Court leaked it. Intentionally I'd say, probably [[Roberts|us.politics.supreme-court.justices.john-roberts]] -trying to feel about how close we are to wide-scale revolt- but we might never know. It could have just as easily been a #Democratic-Justice or a clerk, or a janitor for all we know.

But anyway, it happened, just like we knew it would, and once we are in uncharted territory, less free than we were the day before.

I guess I would have known about it sooner or later. Security at my work came by the warn us that we might want to get the hell out of dodge, as protests were expected the very same day.

The tone from security was more than a bit apprehensive. The protest itself -which I did my level best to attend with three friends- was impossible for us to locate before it was over. So that experience was illuminating. In two ways really.

First it show a lot about how the right expects the left to respond...basically as they would, but perhaps more importantly it shows the left's complete impotence at the moment.

Make no mistake, this isn't just a woman's rights issue, it's a human rights issue. Certainly there is an aspect of this that is purely about controlling and subjugating women, but really though, the party is just getting started.

But hey, we've got manners...

### Ladies first.

But practically speaking the precedent has been set. The state has just assumed for itself the right to force you to further your genetic line.

Even better, if you're a woman, and you'll die in the attempt, **fucking die then. ..**

The situation is obviously much worse for women, who are now called upon in 22 states to adhere to some stranger's version of **God's Plan** for **Their Life**.

We you raped and it resulted in pregnancy? Well, you'll have to carry it to term, because Cleatus things that's **God's Plan**.

### Cleatus

Seem's a bit presumptuous of Cleatus to think he knows what God's Plan is, or that God somehow need's Cleatus's help, when a much simpler explanation is that Cleatus just #Needs-Lithium, but apparently that's not the world we're living any anymore.

At any rate ladies, Cleatus's estimation of God's Plan includes God using a pregnancy to kill you for some apparently divine reason, you being forced to carry your rapists child to term and possibly raise it, you dying to bring your child into this world, and presumably many other horrible outcomes that I can't really envision unless someone tells me about them because **I don't have a womb**.

So have fun with that I suppose. Sounds like a raw deal to me, and honestly I don't think God enters into the real motivation.

## Real Vs Wade

If anyone thinks it’s a coincidence that the moment the noose got so tight the labor force started declining also is the exact moment they decided to outlaw abortions for poor people, I’ve got news for you…you’re broodmares for the engine of capitalism in their eyes.

## Have a blessed day.
