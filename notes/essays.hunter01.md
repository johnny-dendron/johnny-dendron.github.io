I've been thinking about Hunter S. Thompson more than a bit lately, and I can't help thinking what he might make all of this.

I used to have many, many books. I don't anymore, just a few. But I used to, and quite a bit of my library was by or about Hunter. One of those books was a garishly covered reprint of Hell's Angels.

This is literally the worst cover of any printing of the book. I think I picked it up for about ten dollars. I could not tell you why or when. I couldn't tell you if I read this before I read anything by Vonnegut.
