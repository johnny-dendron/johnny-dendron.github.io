## Bio

> The Power Team is a group of Christian evangelists, based in Dallas, Texas. They incorporate their preaching with displays of strength and martial arts skills. They were founded in the late 1970s by John Jacobs.[1] Their performances, usually taped at large megachurches, were broadcast on TBN (and other Christian television stations in the United States) in the late 1980s.
