The republican party is about to give to itself the power to determine election results irregardless of the actual votes.

I wonder what they'll do with that.

You people do understand that the next time the republican party takes power **they will never give it back**â€¦right?

If we don't stand up for ourselves these people are going to walk all over us...like they already are, but by an order of magnitude...you can't even envision it. Neither can they, because these people are so dense that they don't actually know how far they are willing to go.

It's about to get Biblical. Old Testiment Biblical. America's about to find out what it mean's to be given some of that Old Time Religion.

Because the Jerry Fallwell's of the world may pay a lot of lipsevice to their love of Gentle Jesus Meek and Mild, but given their druthers what these people really key on is always the punishments.

Original Sin, Noah's Ark, Sodom and Gamora, Killing All Of Israel's First Born, Armageddon...this is the greatest hit album as far as they are concerned.
