Are people still saying "nobody wants to work?"

If you think it's a coincidence that basically right at the same moment millions upon millions of American's started to be come disillusioned with capitalism, in that same moment the #SupremeCourt, suddenly makes it illegal for poor people to get abortions.

Almost as if, they need a surplus of poor desperate people to keep the whole system running. #Expand

It's not just about controlling women, it's about controlling all of us.

Nobody wants to work, nobody wants to work, nobody wants to work...

Of course nobody wants to work. That's the whole reason MONEY IS INVOLVED.

          - FUCK YOU

It's almost as if it's never going to **TRICKLE DOWN** unless we **RING IT OUT OF THEM**

It's almost as if they feel you owe them you're time and labor and the only reason they are paying you at all is because the government forces them to.

Slaves, yeah, that's slavery...You guys have heard about slavery right? I mean you should have, unless you're a school aged child in Texas right now...who happened to survive the last month, because

> The #Facist Government of Texas has decided the kids can't handle it...

As if American school children are so dub that they won't figure out this country is incredibly unfair and racist if we just don't tell them.

I work for a bank. We just had a merger with another bank. They hired me, to help with the merger. Because I'm a fairly technically handy dude.

That, and the guy they wanted, apparently just didn't want to work.

I doubt that. I very much doubt that.

I think he did not want to **work** _for them_.
