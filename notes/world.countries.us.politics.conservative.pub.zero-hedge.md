## From Wikipedia

> Over time, Zero Hedge expanded into non-financial political content,[c] including conspiracy theories and fringe rhetoric advancing radical right, alt-right, and pro-Russia positions

> The 29 April 2016 "Unmasking Zero Hedge" article by Bloomberg quoted former website staffer Colin Lokey as saying: "I can't be a 24-hour cheerleader for Hezbollah, Moscow, Tehran, Beijing, and Trump anymore. It's wrong. Period. I know it gets you views now, but it will kill your brand over the long run. "
