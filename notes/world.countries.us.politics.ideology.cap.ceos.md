When a CEO says on TV they did something for the community **THEY ARE LYING**.

A corporation exists for **one reason**:

**Profit**.

Everything else is supplemental to that goal.

Capitalism ultimately results in a small number of people owning basically everything and the rest of us are just animals in a pit.
