One thing a lot of comics want to do is get into motivational speaking.

They want that corporate money...because corporations typically pay ridiculous amounts for rather easy tasks.

They can afford to do that, because they work as hard as possible to under pay you..

Now, to get a corporate comedy gig you've got to be clean right.

You've got to be a clean comedian, not just clean right, but you can't express any idea's that might offend anyone ever...

You're working for the starbucks regional human resources bi-annual trust fall convention or whatever...the person who booked you does not want your opinion on anything...

They don't want geroge carlin, they want full house...

Banality pays in that situation.

I have friends who do this on the regular, and they are remarkably good comedians, and they are remarkably good at what they do.

- Fierce devotion to the craft
- Working with a very narrow band of possibilities
- And the way they get around it and stay hillarious is their material and delivery is all on point.
- Micheal Jordan level fundamentals.

But none of those cats do motivational speaking. They work cruise ships, clubs, colleges, asia, and corporate gigs, but as far as I know, they don't do motivational speaking.

And like i said, those gigs pay very well.

What pays even better, is Motivational Speaking...but its kind of hard to sell yourself as a motivation speaker if your a comic because the vast majority of comics are generally broke...and not necessarily successful by the metrics that a business would judge you by to hire you inspire a full of 300 yuppies...

So occasionally you'll find someone who's trying to back door it...get that chedda, and what they will do is put Tony Robbins type crap...into their act, on the hope that they'll get a coprate gig and that will catch the right eye...

which results is the most banal crap...

There seems to be this new phenomenon in entertainment since social media ruined fucking everything for everyone...which is premptively selling out? I mean sure, like a local news talking head, maybe half of them, total toolboxes...people who go out of their way to make sure everything about them tells people higher on the socio-economic scale that they will be their bitch for life for the right price and amount of notoriety...

But since the internet now everybody's doing it?

As far as I'm concerened an influencer is just premtively sells out.

"I'm an influencer"

"Your a sellout!"
Influencer..
"Youre a poor person, looking for a handout, running a grift on a slightly richer person."
You're Elizabeth Theranos Homes.

I don't have a problem with that if these people are only ripping off other rich people...but that never happens.

If Fyre Fest had just bankrupted Ja Rule, that would be fine...but you know what it's done to him and his fortune? NOTHING.

So Anyway, Bret Jennings Sucks.
