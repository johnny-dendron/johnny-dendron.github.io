On windows use **Windows Key + shift + S** to take a crosshairs snapshot to the clipboard. Then use the **command pallet** to **paste image.**

On Mac use **shift+command+5** and **command + option + v** to **paste image**. you may need to set the options to put the image in the clip board.

The other alternative is [[skitch|https://evernote.com/products/skitch]].
