The VS Code Interface constists of....

## Activity Bar

Far Left is the activity bar, which is a long vertical strip with large icons.

It can be moved to the right side with a right click in it, from the view menu, or the command pallet.

## Sidebar

To the right of the **Activity Bar** is the **Sidebar**

The sidebar can be hidden by the view menu, the command pallet, or keyboard shortcuts. I keep **toggle sidebar visibility** set to command/control + \.
